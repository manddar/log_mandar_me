## Hello world

Finally I am ready to switch from my old self hosted wordpress blog to 11ty based blog. I am using [Hylia](https://hylia.website/) starterkit and CMS based on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and deployed to [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Github used as Dev Ops tool to maintain code and netlify auto deploys all the changes made in code automatically.

I will be moving all the older posts from wordpress to this blog, but it will take some time. Feel free to communicate with me on twitter for suggestions and questions.
