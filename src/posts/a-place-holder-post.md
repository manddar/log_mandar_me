Some inspiration first.

> ‚ÄúYou've gotta dance like there's nobody watching, Love like you'll never be hurt, Sing like there's nobody listening, And live like it's heaven on earth.‚Äù - William W. Purkey

and beautiful image.

I'm excited to announce that my blog has officially migrated from self-hosted WordPress to 11ty, and this is my first post on the new platform! I used the [Hylia](https://hylia.website/) starter kit and a [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) CMS, with GitHub for deployment workflow.



I've added emojis to titles and navigation, using copy-paste from [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) to add a touch of visual interest.

While I'll be gradually moving all my older WordPress posts over to the new platform, I'll also be adding new content regularly.



Please feel free to reach out to me on Twitter if you have any suggestions or questions!
