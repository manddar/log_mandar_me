As I mentioned earlier, I plan to write about a variety of topics on this platform, including technology, travel, trading, and anything else that interests me. I believe that writing is an excellent way to share ideas and connect with others, and I'm excited to be a part of this community.



On my Instagram page, I post my favorite photos that I have taken. Photography is one of my hobbies, and I love capturing beautiful moments and sharing them with others. On Twitter, I share my thoughts on various topics, ranging from current events to personal reflections. I find Twitter to be a great platform for sharing ideas and engaging with others.



Similarly, on Facebook, I share interesting articles, videos, and other content that I come across online. I think that Facebook is a great way to stay informed and discover new things.



If you are interested in connecting with me professionally, you can find me on LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a valuable platform for networking and finding new opportunities. I believe that it's important to have a strong professional network, and I'm always looking for ways to expand my connections.



Finally, I am currently working on a project called Open-Interest-Data-Extractor. This project involves extracting data related to open interest from various sources and analyzing it. I think that this project has the potential to be quite valuable in the trading world, and I'm excited to see where it goes.



This website is published and hosted on Netlify, which is a popular platform for hosting static websites. I am using Hylia, which is a lightweight static site generator, to create the website. Hylia is designed to be easy to use and customize, which makes it a great choice for this project.
