Hello there! My name is Mandar and I plan to write about technology, travel, trading, and other random stuff on this platform.

You can find my favorite photos on my 📸 [instagram](https://instagram.com/manddar) page, where I post them regularly. I share my thoughts on various topics on  🐦[twitter](https://twitter.com/manddar), and I also share interesting posts on ✉️[facebook](https://fb.me/manddar). If you want to connect with me professionally, you can find me on 🖥️ [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mandaroak/). Additionally, you can view my public repositories on my ✨ [Github profile](https://github.com/manddar).

🌟 Currently, I am working on a project called [Open-Interest-Data-Extractor](https://github.com/manddar/Open-Interest-Data-Extractor). 
This website is published and hosted on [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia&stack=cms), and I am using [hylia](https://hylia.website/) for it.
